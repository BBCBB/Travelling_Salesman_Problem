2-OPT, 3-OPT, Metropolis Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing.
This repo is under review, making more improvements.
**TSP_3OPT** is kind of **K-OPT** when K=3. In other words, the algorithms strives to choose between 3-opt neighborhoods and 2-opt sub-neighborhoods based the improvement they offer in each iteration.
